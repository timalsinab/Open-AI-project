# Interview Practice Chatbot

## Overview
This project is designed to create a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to assist users in practicing interview questions. The chatbot can simulate interview scenarios by asking and answering common questions. Additionally, the project includes a feature to fetch random jokes from an external API to add a touch of humor to the practice sessions.

Key Features:
- **Interview Question Simulation:** Helps users practice by generating and responding to common interview questions.
- **Random Joke Fetcher:** Provides random jokes to keep the practice sessions engaging and fun.

Setup involves installing necessary Python libraries (`openai`, `requests`) and configuring the OpenAI API key.
